### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jhunior, yeah that is my real name like a Junior, I still consider that I am Junior in many things but I hope to be better in some things some day.

Today I work like Site Reliability Engineer, I still learning better practices to code and identified issues in systems. 

I want to learn more to receive and share knowlodge, I learn a lot of things with wonderful people that coloborated every time in my life and too people that I donÂ´t know that shared knowlodge in differents platforms, and I hope to do the same some day.

Remember, everybody some day were Juniors.

I hope one day to work on some contribution for you or with you.

Have a nice day!
